# Pupil-Detection

``` main.cpp ``` is the driver program of this image processing algorithm for pupil detection, tracking, and response to certain light changes using OpenCV and Python 
This program is integrated with other firmware and libraries for temperature and heart rate sensors and intended to be integrated with  embedded systems (Raspberry pi) to gather heart rate and temperature data from sensor input and process it for analysis
