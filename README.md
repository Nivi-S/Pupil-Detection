# Pupil-Detection

``` main.cpp ``` is the driver program of this image processing algorithm for pupil detection, tracking, and response to certain light changes using OpenCV.

This program requires other firmware and libraries for temperature and heart rate sensors and is intended to be integrated with embedded systems (Raspberry pi) to gather heart rate and temperature data from sensor input and pupil motion videos and process it for analysis.
